## Project Description

This project is aimed at developing a chat application where users can interact and discuss specific GitHub repositories. The application utilizes various technologies and services to provide an interactive and seamless experience for users. The main components of the project include:

1. Authentication: Users are required to provide their Hugging Face token, Activeloop organization name, and Activeloop token to access the application.

2. GitHub Repository Link: Users can enter the link to the GitHub repository they want to discuss. This link is used to retrieve the necessary data and information related to the repository.

3. Data Storage: All the relevant data and information from the GitHub repository are stored in a vector database called Deep Lake. This allows for efficient retrieval and processing of the data during the chat sessions.

4. Chatbot: The project incorporates a language model called [StarChat-Î²](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/starchat-beta), which is an open-source language model available on Hugging Face's model hub. This language model powers the chatbot functionality, enabling users to interact with the chatbot and discuss various aspects of the GitHub repository.

5. Langchain Integration: The chatbot is integrated with the Langchain framework, which facilitates seamless communication between the chatbot, the user, and the GitHub repository data stored in the vector database. This integration ensures smooth and efficient interactions within the chat application.

The project aims to provide an engaging and collaborative platform for users to discuss GitHub repositories using open-source models.
